When we hunt, we need to get a lot of tools to do it right. So now you can check domains in Virus Total using this bash script to automate as possible.

## ðŸ’» Requirements

Before you start, make sure that you environment have these reqs:

* VirusTotal CLI
https://github.com/VirusTotal/vt-cli

## ðŸš€ Running

Create and edit the file with your input list, then run it:
```
chmod +x vtdomainchecker.sh
```
```
./vtdomainchecker.sh
```
> Warting: if you are using a free subscription, you're allowed to make only 4 request per sec. If you have the payd stuff, release my script from sleeping.

## ðŸ“« Contributing for VTDomainChecker

If you like to contribute:

1. If you have any ideas, just open an issue and tell me what you think.
2. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
3. If your vision of a perfect README.md differs greatly from mine, it might be because your projects are vastly different. In this case, you can create a new file README-yourplatform.md and create the perfect boilerplate for that.
